Router project

This is a java project that uses threads to smoothly connect to multiple computers that are supposed to be acting as routers. This was the first time I'd ever done something like this and it shows due to the excess of unused data in the first parts. This is only one of the codes because the code on the other computers would have been the same but with a different starting address.
